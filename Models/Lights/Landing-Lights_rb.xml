    NOTE
    GL_AMBIENT
    params contains four integer or floating-point values that specify
    the ambient RGBA intensity of the light.
    Integer values are mapped linearly such that the most positive representable
    value maps to 1.0,
    and the most negative representable value maps to    -1.0
    .
    Floating-point values are mapped directly.
    Neither integer nor floating-point values are clamped.
    The initial ambient light intensity is (0, 0, 0, 1).
    GL_DIFFUSE
    params contains four integer or floating-point values that specify
    the diffuse RGBA intensity of the light.
    Integer values are mapped linearly such that the most positive representable
    value maps to 1.0,
    and the most negative representable value maps to    -1.0
    .
    Floating-point values are mapped directly.
    Neither integer nor floating-point values are clamped.
    The initial value
    for GL_LIGHT0 is (1, 1, 1, 1); for other lights, the
    initial value is (0, 0, 0, 1).
    GL_SPECULAR
    params contains four integer or floating-point values that specify
    the specular RGBA intensity of the light.
    Integer values are mapped linearly such that the most positive representable
    value maps to 1.0,
    and the most negative representable value maps to    -1.0
    .
    Floating-point values are mapped directly.
    Neither integer nor floating-point values are clamped.
    The initial value
    for GL_LIGHT0 is (1, 1, 1, 1); for other lights, the
    initial value is (0, 0, 0, 1).
    GL_POSITION
    params contains four integer or floating-point values that specify
    the position of the light in homogeneous object coordinates.
    Both integer and floating-point values are mapped directly.
    Neither integer nor floating-point values are clamped.

    The position is transformed by the modelview matrix when
    glLight is called (just as if it were a point),
    and it is stored in eye coordinates.
    If the
    w
    component of the position is 0,
    the light is treated as a directional source.
    Diffuse and specular lighting calculations take the light's direction,
    but not its actual position,
    into account,
    and attenuation is disabled.
    Otherwise,
    diffuse and specular lighting calculations are based on the actual location
    of the light in eye coordinates,
    and attenuation is enabled.
    The initial position is (0, 0, 1, 0);
    thus, the initial light source is directional,
    parallel to, and in the direction of the   -    z    axis.
    GL_SPOT_DIRECTION
    params contains three integer or floating-point values that specify
    the direction of the light in homogeneous object coordinates.
    Both integer and floating-point values are mapped directly.
    Neither integer nor floating-point values are clamped.

    The spot direction is transformed by the upper 3x3 of the modelview matrix when
    glLight is called,
    and it is stored in eye coordinates.
    It is significant only when GL_SPOT_CUTOFF is not 180,
    which it is initially.
    The initial direction is    0    0    -1
    .
    GL_SPOT_EXPONENT
    params is a single integer or floating-point value that specifies
    the intensity distribution of the light.
    Integer and floating-point values are mapped directly.
    Only values in the range    0    128    are accepted.

    Effective light intensity is attenuated by the cosine of the angle between
    the direction of the light and the direction from the light to the vertex
    being lighted,
    raised to the power of the spot exponent.
    Thus, higher spot exponents result in a more focused light source,
    regardless of the spot cutoff angle (see GL_SPOT_CUTOFF, next paragraph).
    The initial spot exponent is 0,
    resulting in uniform light distribution.
    GL_SPOT_CUTOFF
    params is a single integer or floating-point value that specifies
    the maximum spread angle of a light source.
    Integer and floating-point values are mapped directly.
    Only values in the range    0    90    and the special value 180    are accepted.

    If the angle between the direction of the light and the direction from the
    light to the vertex being lighted is greater than the spot cutoff angle,
    the light is completely masked.
    Otherwise, its intensity is controlled by the spot exponent and the
    attenuation factors.
    The initial spot cutoff is 180,
    resulting in uniform light distribution.
    GL_CONSTANT_ATTENUATIONGL_LINEAR_ATTENUATIONGL_QUADRATIC_ATTENUATION
    params is a single integer or floating-point value that specifies
    one of the three light attenuation factors.
    Integer and floating-point values are mapped directly.
    Only nonnegative values are accepted.
    If the light is positional,
    rather than directional,
    its intensity is attenuated by the reciprocal of the sum of the constant
    factor, the linear factor times the distance between the light
    and the vertex being lighted,
    and the quadratic factor times the square of the same distance.
    The initial attenuation factors are (1, 0, 0),
    resulting in no attenuation.
