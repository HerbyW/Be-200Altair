For Version 3.4.0 and 3.4.1 and 2016.x.x and 2017.x.x and 2018.x.x of Flightgear:

Copy
     wildfire.nas
                        >>>>>into fgdata/Nasal
                        
Copy 
     fire.xml
     smoke.xml
     wildfire.xml
                        >>>>>>into fgdata/Models/Effects/Wildfire
                        
The nas-file will give you some information from the copilot: If there is a fire around you and if you have deleted it.
My change is very little: only one message to the copilot in line: 904

The 3 other files make the wildfire a little bit less consuming your framerate,
so that it should be possible to fight fire until 120 fires are comming up,
then you have to deactivate the wildfire settings and enable them again.

Maybe in the future I try to adjust the nas-file to a much more less consuming version.
The problem is, then it will only work if every player has this version!
